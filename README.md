# lucent

lucent is a lightweight web server, with a mostly RFC-compliant implementation of HTTP/1.1 written from scratch (as a
fun exercise). Major features include:

- URL rewriting
- CGI/NPH scripting support
- Generated directory listings
- HTTPS (with [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls))
- HTTP basic authentication

It should be quick and easy to spin up an instance; see the [usage](#usage) section.
