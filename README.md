# lucent
Lucent is a web server written in Rust with a number of features (including CGI/NPH script execution, URL rewriting, dynamically generated directory listings, crude HTTP basic authentication, a simple template engine, and HTTPS support with rustls) and an implementation of HTTP/1.1 written from the ground up. The goal of this project wasn't to build a production ready web server, but just to implement a large subset of the HTTP/1.1 spec in order to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. Despite this, it's turned out to be usable enough in serving my [website](https://lunarcoffee.cf).
